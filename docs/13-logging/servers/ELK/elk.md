# ELK stack
Among the most popular logging implementations is the ELK stack, an alias for a 
combination of products from Elastic (https://www.elastic.co/): Elasticsearch (the 
storage system with powerful text search features), Logstash (the agent to channel logs to 
Elasticsearch from multiple sources), and Kibana (the UI tool to manage and query logs).

## Integration with Spring Cloud
