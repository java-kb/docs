# Static Code Analysis
After a developer pushes new code to the mainline, the commit stage starts by check-
ing out the source code from the repository. The starting point is always a commit to
the main branch. 

Next, the pipeline can perform several types of static code analysis such as vulnerability scanning, identify security issues and check compliance with specific coding standards (code linting).
