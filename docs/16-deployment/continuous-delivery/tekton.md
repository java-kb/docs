# Tekton
 Tekton (https://tekton.dev) is a popu-
lar choice for defining deployment pipelines and other software workflows.
Itâ€™s an open source and Kubernetes-native solution hosted at the Continuous
Delivery Foundation (https://cd.foundation). It runs directly on a cluster and
lets you declare pipelines and tasks as Kubernetes custom resources.
