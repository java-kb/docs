# Security

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is

## Authorization 
Authorization is the process of giving someone the ability to access a digital resource. To keep sensitive information protected, you should limit user access to only the resources that they need.

## Single-factor Authentication (SFA)
Requires users to provide one verifiable credential to access online resources.
 
## Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
Requires users to provide two verifiable credentials to access online resources.
 
## Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Requires users to provide at least two verifiable credentials to access online resources. 

## FIDO
FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is a set of open, standardized authentication protocols intended to ultimately eliminate the use of passwords for authentication. Passwords are costly to manage and a known security risk because they are easily compromised.
